For my code for Assignment 1 Part 1. First, I ask the user to input the size of array, then use random function to crate different random number to fill the random array. Then, I transfer test array to all five classes. In each class, there is a timer function to calculate the time that sort function need and return time to main function. Beside, there is also a ¡°check¡± function to check the output of the sort function is correct or not. In check function, I use Array.sort.() function so sort original arrays. And set another array ¡°arr2¡± to sort with my sorting function. If all the values are correct, the timer function will transfer ¡°diff¡± to main class which is the time cost by sort function. If there are any values that not match, the timer function will transfer ¡°-1¡± to main class which means the output is incorrect for my sort function.
